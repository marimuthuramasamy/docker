What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization.

 What is a container?
A container is a lightweight and isolated environment that encapsulates an application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.

How is Docker different from virtualization?
Virtualization emulates an entire operating system, while Docker containers share the host system’s kernel and only isolate the application processes.

What is Docker image?
A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application and all its dependencies. It is used to create Docker containers.

How do you create a Docker image?
You can create a Docker image using a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building the image.

What is a Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and other configurations.

What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application’s services and their dependencies.

How do you link containers in Docker?
In Docker, you can link containers using the — link flag or by creating a user-defined network and connecting containers to the network.

How do you link containers in Docker?
In Docker, you can link containers using the — link flag or by creating a user-defined network and connecting containers to the network.

What is the difference between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?
Docker Swarm is a simpler and less feature-rich orchestration tool compared to Kubernetes. It is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments, while Kubernetes is more scalable and suitable for complex, large-scale deployments.

How do you scale Docker containers?
You can scale Docker containers manually by running multiple instances of the same container or use orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to automatically scale the containers based on predefined rules.

How does Docker ensure security?
Docker provides security through isolation by using kernel namespaces and control groups. It also supports various security features such as user namespaces, seccomp, and AppArmor profiles.

What is the difference between a Docker container and an image?
An image is a template used to create containers. Containers are running instances of images that have their own filesystem and can be started, stopped, and managed.

How can you share Docker images with others?
You can share Docker images with others by pushing them to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry. Others can then pull the image from the registry to use it.

How do you manage data persistence in Docker?
Data persistence in Docker can be achieved by using Docker volumes or mounting host directories into containers. Docker volumes provide a way to manage and share data between containers and also persist data even if the containers are removed.

What is the purpose of Dockerfile’s ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions?
The ENTRYPOINT instruction specifies the command that will be executed when the container starts. The CMD instruction provides default arguments to the entry point command.

How can you access logs from a Docker container?
You can access logs from a Docker container using the docker logs command followed by the container ID or name.

How can you pass environment variables to a Docker container?
You can pass environment variables to a Docker container using the -e flag followed by the variable name and value when running the docker run command.

What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?
A Docker image is a static, read-only file that contains the application and its dependencies, while a Docker container is a running instance of an image that has its own state and can be started, stopped, and managed.

How do you remove Docker images and containers?
You can remove Docker images using the docker rmi command followed by the image ID or name. Containers can be removed using the docker rm command followed by the container ID or name.

What is Docker Registry?
Docker Registry is a service that stores and distributes Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public Docker Registry, but you can also set up your own private registry.

How can you update a Docker image?
To update a Docker image, you need to rebuild it with the necessary changes and then push the updated image to the Docker registry. Existing containers can be stopped and recreated with the new image.

What are Docker volumes?
Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They provide a mechanism for managing and sharing data between containers, as well as persisting data even if the containers are removed.

How can you list Docker containers?
You can list Docker containers using the docker ps command. The -a flag can be used to display all containers, including the ones that are not currently running.

What is the purpose of Docker networks?
Docker networks provide a way to enable communication between containers running on the same host or across different hosts. They allow containers to discover and connect to each other using container names.

How do you update Docker containers?
To update a Docker container, you need to stop the existing container, pull the updated image from the Docker registry, and then start a new container with the updated image.

What is the difference between COPY and ADD instructions in a Dockerfile?
The COPY instruction in a Dockerfile copies files and directories from the build context to the image. The ADD instruction can do the same but also supports additional features like extracting tar archives and downloading files from URLs.

What is the role of a Dockerfile’s EXPOSE instruction?
The EXPOSE instruction in a Dockerfile informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. It does not actually publish the ports to the host, but it is useful for documentation purposes and when creating container links.

What is the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to create, package, and run applications in containers. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

How can you clean up unused Docker resources?
You can clean up unused Docker resources using the docker system prune command. This command removes unused images, containers, volumes, and networks, freeing up disk space. Use it with caution, as it permanently deletes resources.
